=begin   
- P - 
I/p - natural number and set of one or more numbers
o/p - sum of all the multiples of the given set, which is less than natural number

Note - If we don't given the set of numbers - default should be (3,5)

- E - 
  assert_equal 233_168, SumOfMultiples.to(1000)
  assert_equal 51, SumOfMultiples.new(7, 13, 17).to(20)

-from the test cases,
  constructor method - takes list of numbers , if the list is not given, [3,5] should be taken
  
   
- D
    - data can can be an array
