## what are the benefits of using Object oriented Programming in Ruby?
1. avaoid repitition in codes 
2. allows programmers to think more abstractly about the code they are writing
3. Objetcs are represented by nouns, so are easier to conceptualize
4. it allow us to expose functinality to the parts of code that need it
(meaning namespace issues are much harder to come across.)
5. We can build applications faster as we can by reusing pre-written code
6. As the software becomes more complex, this complexity can be more easily managed
